# Migration errors and anomolies

## Parsing issues

- [ ] Loads of old LJ posts used table based layouts to format a mosaic of photos. Translating those to use CSS grids or something along those lines would be a nice upgrade.
- [ ] Tumblr id `459649779` has a raw YouTube embed in the body that the `toMarkdown()` function is stripping out rather than keeping as a free-floating URL.
- [ ] Tumblr Link posts often have 'via Xâ€¦' metadata about the original source of the share. The actual share links are in some weird places, though, and deserve some extra attention. Right now, they're unhandled.
- [x] Pinboard has copies of my Delicious links; deduplicating them and preserving the Delicious attribution would be nice.
- [x] Clean generation of 'threaded sort-order' keyes for arbitrary comments is now in place. Woo. It duplicates Drupal's comment-sort ID generator, and works on imported Disqus threads as well. I'll be using it on Twitter threads as well, to preserve hierarchy on threads with weird discursive sub-trees of interspersed replies.
  - [ ] Right now it's hard coded to use `id`, `parent`, and `thread` properties: that works with the CommentSchema entity but for other data it'd be nice to make it configurable.

/**
 * Photo
 *
 * An individual photograph, almost always hosted somewhere else. Not all of my work
 * gets rolled into the graph; these are essentially "featured" photos chosen from
 * my flickr feed, instagram feed, and also from pre-web2 manually curated photo posts.
 *
 * Long term this might include integration with something like {@link https://glass.photo};
 * their API looks interesting and might be a better match for curated stuff that I
 * care about. Just another service, though, which is always a roll of the dice.

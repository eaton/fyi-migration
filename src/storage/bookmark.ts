 * - Bookmarking services
 *   - Shouldn't be private/local-only sites, or registration-walled
 *   - Should be de-duplicated across services when those services were
 *     mirroring each other
 * - Blog posts
 *   - Only single-link posts with short content. Optionally, splitting it
 *     into short content with an accompanying `note` if it's unambiguously
 *     a post ABOUT the link.
 *   - blogroll links (keep any categorization as keywords for each bookmark)
 * - Static sites
 *   - Only external links

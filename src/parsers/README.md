# Parser Collection

This is a grab bag of semi-reusable file type parsers that don't belong to a single, specific import. Generally speaking, each one is an exported module with a parse function, an Options interface, and a set of type definitions for each important bit of data returned by the parse function.

## Disqus

Takes a string or buffer containing a raw Disqus XML export, returns all of the account's categories, threads, and posts. By default, it will also:

- Discard deleted posts and spam posts
- Copy thread/category metadata to each post so they can be used in isolation
- Generate a 'sortable key' for each post, reflecting its position in a hierarchical discussion thread.
- Hierarchicalize the data, grouping posts under their thread, threads under their categories.
- Sort threads by their creation date and posts by their 'sortable key'.

## MDB

Accepts the path of an MS Access database and returns a data structure containing its metadata, tables, and table rows. Additional functions include:

- Parse *a specific table* and validate every row using a Zod schema
- Extract just the Db metadata â€” creation date, password, and a list of tables (including internal system tables)

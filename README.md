# Eaton FYI migration scripts

There'sâ€¦ an awful lot of stuff to process.

## Blogs

Posts and entries from the assorted places I've written over the years.

`Textfiles` and `Livejournal` in particular will probably need some post-migration curation and careful consideration. Many of those posts were never intended to be publicly published, are extremely full of teen and post-college cringe, or contain snippets of personal information about folks who probably didn't anticipate their melodrama spilling out.
